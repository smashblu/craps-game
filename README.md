# Browser Craps

## Introduction

`Browser Craps` is a simple browser-based Craps game where the player tries to beat the house with random dice rolls.

## Rules

### Pregame

The player starts the game with $100 and can bet any amount each roll. The player wins when `[win condition]`. The player loses if their money reaches $0.

### Sessions

Once a bet is placed, the player rolls two 6 sided die. They win their bet when a 7 or 11 is rolled and lose when a 2, 3, or 12 is rolled. If 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 are rolled, a point is opened. The new goal is to roll that same number again before rolling a 7.
