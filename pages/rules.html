    <h2 id="what-is-craps">What is Craps?</h2>
    <p>Craps is dice casino game. It is player vs. house, rather than player
        vs. player. The goal is to win as much money as possible from the
        house.</p>
    <p>The game is played in rounds. Each round consists of betting and
        rolling. When rolling, the player rolls two 6-sided dice which
        determines the possible winner of the round.</p>
    <h2 id="starting-the-game">Starting the Game</h2>
    <p>Once clicking the “Start Game” button (or “New Game” from the Game
        Menu), the player is given $100 to bet with.</p>
    <h2 id="making-a-bet">Making a Bet</h2>
    <p>When the round starts, the player can make a bet in any amount they
        choose. This bet is then locked in and the dice can then be rolled. The
        game is over if the player’s money reaches $0.</p>
    <h2 id="rolling-the-dice">Rolling the Dice</h2>
    <p>After a bet is made, the dice can be rolled. The outcome of the roll
        will determine the <strong>point</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the roll is a <strong>7</strong> or <strong>11</strong>, the bet
            automatically wins</li>
        <li>If the roll is a <strong>2</strong>, <strong>3</strong>, or
            <strong>12</strong>, the bet automatically loses
        </li>
        <li>If the roll is any other number, it becomes the
            <strong>point</strong>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="the-point">The Point</h2>
    <p>The point becomes the target number the player wants to roll to win.
        There are six possible points with three scales of difficulty:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <strong>easy</strong> points are <strong>6</strong> and
            <strong>8</strong>
        </li>
        <li>The <strong>medium</strong> points are <strong>5</strong> and
            <strong>9</strong>
        </li>
        <li>The <strong>hard</strong> points are <strong>4</strong> and
            <strong>10</strong>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The object of the game is roll the point before a <strong>7</strong>
        is rolled. At this time, any other numbers are irrelevant.</p>
    <h2 id="other-bets">Other Bets</h2>
    <p>While the <strong>point</strong> is active, there are other bets that
        can be made.</p>
    <h3 id="come-bets">Come Bets</h3>
    <p>A <strong>come</strong> bet is essentially determining a new point
        while the current point is active. When a <strong>come</strong> bet is
        placed, it is noted and the dice are rolled. Based on the outcome of the
        next roll, the <em>come</em> bet will activate. The activation is
        exactly the same as the initial bet rules, a <strong>7</strong> or
        <strong>11</strong> wins, a <strong>2</strong>, <strong>3</strong>, or
        <strong>12</strong> loses. Finally, any other number moves the
        <strong>come</strong> bet to that number and stays there until either a
        <strong>7</strong> or the <strong>come</strong> point is rolled. If the
        original <strong>point</strong> is rolled, the <strong>come</strong> bet
        is unaffected and remains active.
    </p>
    <h3 id="place-bets">Place Bets</h3>
    <p>A <strong>place</strong> bet is a bet on a specific number. The
        player can choose any of the six numbers on the board to make a
        <strong>place</strong> bet and the desired amount. All numbers besides
        the point can have a <strong>place</strong>. The object of the
        <strong>place</strong> bet becomes rolling that number before a
        <strong>7</strong> is rolled. If the original <strong>point</strong> is
        rolled, the <strong>place</strong> bet is returned to the player (a
        “push”).
