## What is Craps?

Craps is dice casino game. It is player vs. house, rather than player vs. player. The goal is to win as much money as possible from the house.

The game is played in rounds. Each round consists of betting and rolling. When rolling, the player rolls two 6-sided dice which determines the possible winner of the round.

## Starting the Game

Once clicking the "Start Game" button (or "New Game" from the Game Menu), the player is given $100 to bet with.

## Making a Bet

When the round starts, the player can make a bet in any amount they choose. This bet is then locked in and the dice can then be rolled. The game is over if the player's money reaches $0.

## Rolling the Dice

After a bet is made, the dice can be rolled. The outcome of the roll will determine the **point**.

- If the roll is a **7** or **11**, the bet automatically wins
- If the roll is a **2**, **3**, or **12**, the bet automatically loses
- If the roll is any other number, it becomes the **point**

## The Point

The point becomes the target number the player wants to roll to win. There are six possible points with three scales of difficulty:

- The **easy** points are **6** and **8**
- The **medium** points are **5** and **9**
- The **hard** points are **4** and **10**

The object of the game is roll the point before a **7** is rolled. At this time, any other numbers are irrelevant.

## Other Bets

While the **point** is active, there are other bets that can be made.

### Come Bets

A **come** bet is essentially determining a new point while the current point is active. When a **come** bet is placed, it is noted and the dice are rolled. Based on the outcome of the next roll, the *come* bet will activate. The activation is exactly the same as the initial bet rules, a **7** or **11** wins, a **2**, **3**, or **12** loses. Finally, any other number moves the **come** bet to that number and stays there until either a **7** or the **come** point is rolled. If the original **point** is rolled, the **come** bet is unaffected and remains active.

### Place Bets

A **place** bet is a bet on a specific number. The player can choose any of the six numbers on the board to make a **place** bet and the desired amount. All numbers besides the point can have a **place**. The object of the **place** bet becomes rolling that number before a **7** is rolled. If the original **point** is rolled, the **place** bet is returned to the player (a "push").
